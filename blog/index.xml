      <description>Performance monitoring solutions can provide valuable insights for making decisions such as hull cleaning, propeller polishing, vessel rehiring, and associated negotiations. With the ongoing digitalization of the shipping industry, data is available in abundance for building performance analysis tools. However, drawing actionable insights from such data can be challenging. Existing performance monitoring solutions fall short because of the following reasons:
“The differentiating factor between various performance monitoring solutions is not the machine learning algorithm but how the system deals with the inputs and outputs of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>The marine industry is aligning its efforts to promote international shipping decarbonization. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set an ambitious goal to reduce shipping&amp;rsquo;s total annual Greenhouse Gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050. As a first step to achieving this goal, IMO has introduced a standard metric for the current emission efficiency of ships called the Annual Emission Ratio (AER). AER measures the emission efficiency in terms of grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and distance sailed.</description>

      <description>Blue Water is excited to announce the release of Qaira – Query and information retrieval agent. Qaira (pronounced as Kyra) is a smart and intuitive virtual assistant, that provides data driven answers to questions regarding your fleet. With BOSS digesting data from various sources each minute, Qaira offers an intelligent interface that can analyze data in real time and deliver information useful for decision making.
Digitization and automation are the future of the shipping industry and we at Blue Water strive to stay a step ahead in this ever evolving industry.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Fuel Savings</title>

      <description>With increasing fuel prices and environmental awareness, maximizing energy efficiency is one of the highest priorities in voyage planning. Various weather routing algorithms have shown great potential in optimizing main engine fuel consumption while ensuring safe navigation. However, quantifying the fuel savings achieved by using these services remains a major challenge in the marine industry. The lack of a transparent and logical benchmarking system for comparing fuel consumption with and without engaging a fuel optimization service is the main roadblock in calculating fuel savings.</description>
