The marine industry is aligning its efforts to promote international shipping decarbonization. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set an ambitious goal to reduce shipping&amp;rsquo;s total annual Greenhouse Gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050. As a first step to achieve this goal, IMO has introduced a standard metric for the current emission efficiency of ships which is measured in terms of grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and distance sailed.</description></item><item><title>BOSS 2021 Rewind</title><link>/blog/2021rewind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:28:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021rewind/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Because BOSS needs an assistant</title><link>/blog/qaira/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 16:28:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/qaira/</guid><description>Blue Water is excited to announce the release of Qaira â€“ Query and information retrieval agent.

Various weather routing algorithms have shown great potential in optimizing main engine fuel consumption while ensuring safe navigation. However, quantifying the fuel savings achieved by using these services remains a major challenge in the marine industry. The lack of a transparent and logical benchmarking system for comparing fuel consumption with and without engaging a fuel optimization service is the main roadblock in calculating fuel savings.</description></item></channel></rss>
