      <title>Vessel Performance Monitoring </title>

      <description>BOSS performance modules can consume data from noon reports and also sensor data API. Sensor data promises noise-free and accurate data logging. However, miscalibrated sensors, hardware, and network issues can result in missing or inconsistent data. Also, many commercial and compliance reports like emission reports and performance claims are exclusively based on the reported noon data.
Error-free and accurate noon report data can be valuable not only for generating commercial reports but also for technical performance analysis and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Manage and Optimize Marine Emissions with BOSS</title>

      <description>While CII standardizes the metrics for measuring maritime emissions, the Sea Cargo Charter (SCC) establishes a framework for assessing and disclosing the emissions from ship chartering activities around the globe. Signatories of the SCC are required to report their emissions data for each voyage in a standard format. The emissions for each voyage are aggregated from the first ballast leg and need to be apportioned between various sub-charterers for voyages carrying parcels from multiple charterers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Fuel Savings</title>

      <description>With increasing fuel prices and environmental awareness, maximizing energy efficiency is one of the highest priorities in voyage planning. Various weather routing algorithms have shown great potential in optimizing main engine fuel consumption while ensuring safe navigation. However, quantifying the fuel savings achieved by using these services remains a major challenge in the marine industry. The lack of a transparent and logical benchmarking system for comparing fuel consumption with and without engaging a fuel optimization service is the main roadblock in calculating fuel savings.</description>
