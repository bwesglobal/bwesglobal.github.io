As we step into the new year, we proudly look back on the strides we&rsquo;ve taken in 2023 to contribute to the green revolution in shipping. With the ambitious target of achieving zero emissions by 2050 looming on the horizon, our commitment to innovation has been instrumental in guiding us towards a sustainable future. Our flagship solution, BOSS (Blue Water Optimum Speed Services), has been at the forefront of our efforts, empowering our clients to navigate the seas with increased efficiency, reduced emissions, and a clear roadmap toward a zero-emission future.
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="/images/2023Recap/REW23.jpg" alt="Recap 2023" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
Over the past year, we undertook a series of initiatives that have yielded tangible results. Despite experiencing substantial growth in our clientele, we have remained committed to ensuring that BOSS remains customizable to meet each client&rsquo;s unique requirements. Amidst constantly evolving emission and compliance guidelines, BOSS has played a crucial role in logging and posting comprehensive and validated vessel data. Our reporting and optimization services have advanced from Oil Tankers, Bulk carriers, and LNG vessels to also include Containers, PCTC, and vessels carrying highly sophisticated deck cargoes. We are proud to announce that this year, we weather-routed the world’s first hydrogen carrier.</p>

<p>As we step into the new year, let’s take a look at the highlights of 2023</p>

<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>

<p>Our strategic collaborations with industry leaders such as DNV, Shell LNG, Oldendorff, and Pacific Basin have been pivotal in shaping our journey toward sustainability. These partnerships have not only strengthened our expertise but have also allowed us to align with global leaders in compliance assurance, emission reduction, and so on. Together, we&rsquo;ve pooled resources and knowledge to address challenges, drive innovation, and set new benchmarks for sustainability in the maritime sector</p>

<h4 id="validated-vessel-reporting-compliance-cross-platform-data-posting">Validated Vessel Reporting, Compliance &amp; Cross-Platform Data Posting</h4>

<p>Ensuring compliance with environmental regulations has been a top priority in 2023. Our vessel reporting system (MIRROR and C-ORCA) underwent major enhancements and emerged as the industry’s preferred choice for vessel data reporting and voyage management. Our goal was clear - to create a versatile noon reporting system with zero tolerance for misreporting and errors. MIRROR and C-ORCA cover over 70 vessel-specific validations that are handled using a unique AI-assisted monitoring system. The modular design of MIRROR forms allows easy customization as per the client’s requirements. This year, our average turn-around time for creating, testing, and deploying MIRROR forms for a new client has been less than 2 weeks. Uncompromising data validations in MIRROR allow seamless integration with third-party platforms such as Veslink/IMOS, DNV and BI systems. In 2023, we logged, validated, and posted 292 K vessel reports into 3rd party platforms.</p>

<p>Our focus on validated data Reporting and Optimization under EU-ETS/CII, SCC, and data posting into third-party platforms reflects our dedication to meeting and exceeding regulatory standards. By meticulously addressing reporting errors and streamlining processes, we&rsquo;ve not only enhanced our clients&rsquo; compliance but also contributed to the overall reduction of carbon footprints in the shipping industry.</p>

<h4 id="lng-voyage-management-and-optimization">LNG Voyage Management and Optimization</h4>

<p>LNG carriers pose unique challenges in data reporting and voyage optimization. Traditionally, optimizing LNG voyages focused mainly on weather routing. However, unlocking the full potential of LNG optimization requires a delicate balance between factors like boil-off rate, speed, course, and commercial considerations. Our year-long effort has resulted in the creation of the most comprehensive LNG voyage optimization solution. With advanced machine learning and thermodynamic models, BOSS can achieve proven bunker savings of 5-7% while ensuring punctual arrivals. This state-of-the-art system efficiently plans and monitors LNG voyages, integrating optimal boil-off-gas management, speed scheduling, and weather routing. In 2023, we onboarded 85 LNG vessels into our platform across 5 clients. Read more to see how BOSS tackles the unique challenges of LNG Voyage Optimization and Reporting.</p>

<h4 id="mobile-application">Mobile Application</h4>

<p>In May 2023, we launched the BOSS mobile app on both Apple and Android app stores. Now BOSS users can monitor their vessels in real-time and stay updated through instant notifications, all from the convenience of their mobile device. With the BOSS mobile app, users can stay on top of their vessel’s ETA, receive alerts for underperformance, track maintenance schedules, and more. This level of real-time visibility will enable users to make informed decisions and respond quickly to any unexpected events that may arise. Additionally, the app will provide access to weather data, and route visualization, along with other features that are already available on the BOSS web service.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/blogimages/mobileapp/app_screenshots.jpg" alt="Mobile App" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"></center></p>

<h4 id="in-port-analysis">In-port Analysis</h4>

<p>We are excited to introduce our latest innovation—a solution designed to optimise fuel consumption during port operations. Harness the benefits of machine learning-driven fuel consumption estimates, vessel-class benchmarking, and port-specific customization for superior performance optimization. Our careful monitoring and alert system guarantees accuracy, providing timely notifications for any deviations. With a focus on emissions control, our shared best practices contribute to an improved Carbon Intensity Index (CII) rating, fostering sustainability and efficiency in your maritime operations. This comprehensive module reflects our dedication to excellence in maritime operations, offering an end-to-end, optimized solution.</p>

<h4 id="cargo-heating-management-service">Cargo Heating Management Service</h4>

<p>2023 marks the 15th year anniversary of our flagship Cargo Heating Management (CHM) service. CHM ensures a remarkable 20-30% reduction in fuel usage in cargo heating while steadfastly adhering to charter party heating instructions. Backed by professional advisory support, meticulous monitoring through Daily Heating Telegrams(DHT), and prompt decision-making, our commitment extends beyond streamlining onboard activities. We concurrently achieve substantial reductions in direct costs, man-hours, and greenhouse gas emissions. Entrust us with safeguarding your cargo quality and join us in fostering a sustainable future.</p>

<h4 id="boss-on-demand-bond">Boss On Demand (BOND)</h4>

<p>2023 concluded with the launch of one of our most ambitious projects - BOND (BOSS on Demand). BOND is a self-service platform to access and customize our voyage optimization and reporting suite that is trusted by industry leaders including oil majors, charterers, and ship owners. Its modular, self-service approach ensures that companies subscribe only to what is essential for their unique operations. From validated data reporting to real-time fleet monitoring, BOND is a comprehensive solution for the modern maritime enterprise, propelling operations into a new era of efficiency, compliance, and excellence.</p>

<h4 id="future-initiatives">Future Initiatives</h4>

<p>Looking ahead, our commitment to technical advancements remains unwavering. Future endeavors include innovations in weather routing with a focus on vessel rolling, parametric and synchronous rolling, ICE navigation guidance, and an expansion of BOND capabilities. Additionally, we&rsquo;re gearing up for bio-fuel reporting and API-enabled vessel report validation for class approval, further solidifying our position as pioneers in sustainable shipping solutions.</p>

<p>As we navigate the green seas of sustainable shipping, our achievements in 2023 are not just milestones but a testament to our commitment to a zero-emission future. By leveraging technology, fostering collaborations, and staying ahead of regulatory requirements, we are not only meeting the demands of the present but also actively shaping the future of the maritime industry. The journey toward sustainability is ongoing, and with BOSS as our compass, we are confident in our ability to lead the way towards a cleaner, greener maritime future.</p>
